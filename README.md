# Gaussian Process

#### What is a Gaussian Process:

- **Simple explenation**: A Gaussian process is a probability distribution over possible functions that fit a set of points.

- **Deeper understanding**: [Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning](http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/chapters/RW.pdf) gives detailed insights.
